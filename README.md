## About
This is a sales insight data analysis project using tableau. This project will give you a feel of how data analysis projects are executed in big companies. Our case study is based on a computer hardware business which facing challenges in dynamically chainging market. So taking the role of a Sales director I have built a Tableau dashboard to get real time sales insight. 

## Problem Statement and Aim
We are dealing with a hardware company which suppllies computers, peripherals and networking devices to various clients in different cities in India. Recently the sales have been declining and the sales director wants to know what has caused the downfall. When he asks regional managers for the insights, they provide him with large Excel files. 
With these numbers we cannot get any insights so we use Business Intelligence tool like Tableau to get useful insights through visualizations. Based on these insights the sales director can make better business decisions.

## Requirements
 1. My SQL workbench to get basic data  analysis and cleaning
 2. Tableau to create dashboards based on the cleaned data
